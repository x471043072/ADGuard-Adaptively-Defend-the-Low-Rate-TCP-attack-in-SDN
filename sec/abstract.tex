The low-rate TCP attack is essentially a great threat to the Internet. It can cause significant throughput degradation of TCP flows by generating periodically pulsing flows. Due to its low rate, the attack is hard to be detected and throttled. Fortunately, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) shows great benefits on defending network threats due to its centralized control and flexible programmability. In this paper, we propose \TheName{}, which is an SDN-based defense that can effectively mitigate the low-rate TCP attack. \TheName{} detects the atack by installing crafted flow rules into switches to check aggregated TCP throughput degradation. It accurately identifies attack flows by judging whether there is periodicity for a flow based on adaptive fast fourier transfrom method. Identified attack flows will be effectively throttled by installing mitigation rules. We implement \TheName{} in the Floodlight controller. Experiments in a real SDN testbed demonstrate its effectiveness on defending against the low-rate TCP attack.
