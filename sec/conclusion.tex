In this paper, we present \TheName to adaptive detect and defend against low-rate TCP attacks in SDN. We present the model of the low rate TCP attack. And then we design and implement a detection mechanism which takes advantage of periodicity and MED to detect the low rate TCP attack in SDN. We show that the detection is accurate and effective in identifying the attack flows. When the low-rate TCP attack is present, we install flow rule to defend the identified attack hosts in the access switch for the minimum influence of the attack due to the advantage of SDN. Experiments in a real SDN testbed consisting of commercial hardware switches demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of \TheName{}.
